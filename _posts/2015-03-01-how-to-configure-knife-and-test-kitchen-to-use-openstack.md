When developing Chef cookbooks, Knife and Test Kitchen (hereafter just "Kitchen") are essential tools in the workflow. Both tools can be set up to use OpenStack to make it easy to create VMs for testing regardless of the capabilities of the workstation used. It's great for testing some new recipe in a cookbook or making sure changes do not break existing cookbook functionality. This post will go through the configuration of both tools to ensure they use OpenStack instead of the default Vagrant drivers.

## Install software and dependencies

First, it is necessary to install the software, plugins and dependencies. Let's start with some basic packages:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9 git
sudo apt-get install make autoconf gcc g++ zlib1g-dev bundler
{% endhighlight %}

### Chef Development Kit

The [Chef Development Kit](https://docs.chef.io/#chef-dk-title "Chef Development Kit") is a collection of very useful tools for any cookbook developer. It includes tools like Knife, Kitchen, Berkshelf, Foodcritic, and more. Fetch download links for the current release from the [Chef-DK download page](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/ "Chef-DK download page") and install it, for example like this for Ubuntu:

{% highlight shell %}
wget https://opscode-omnibus-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu/12.04/x86_64/chefdk_0.4.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i chefdk_0.4.0-1_amd64.deb
{% endhighlight %}

### Kitchen OpenStack driver

By default, Kitchen uses Vagrant as the driver to create virtual machines for running tests. To get OpenStack support, install the [Kitchen OpenStack driver](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-openstack "Kitchen OpenStack driver"). The recommended way of installing it is to add the Ruby gem to the Gemfile in your cookbook and use Bundler to install it:

{% highlight shell %}
echo 'gem "kitchen-openstack"' >> Gemfile
sudo bundle
{% endhighlight %}

### Knife OpenStack plugin

With the [OpenStack plugin](https://github.com/chef/knife-openstack "Knife OpenStack plugin") Knife is able to create new OpenStack VMs and bootstrap them as nodes on your Chef server. It can also list VMs and delete VMs. Install the plugin with:

{% highlight shell %}
gem install knife-openstack
{% endhighlight %}

### OpenStack command line clients

The command line clients for OpenStack are very useful for checking values like image IDs, Neutron networks and so on. In addition, they offer one-line access to actions like creating new VMs, allocating new floating IPs and more. Install the clients with:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install python-novaclient python-neutronclient python-glanceclient
{% endhighlight %}

## Configure Knife to use OpenStack

After installing the plugin to get OpenStack support for Knife, you need to append some lines to the Knife config file "~/.chef/knife.rb":

{% highlight shell %}
cat >> ~/.chef/knife.rb <<EOF
# Knife OpenStack plugin setup
knife[:openstack_auth_url] = "#{ENV['OS_AUTH_URL']}/tokens"
knife[:openstack_username] = "#{ENV['OS_USERNAME']}"
knife[:openstack_password] = "#{ENV['OS_PASSWORD']}"
knife[:openstack_tenant] = "#{ENV['OS_TENANT_NAME']}"
EOF
{% endhighlight %}

What these lines do is to instruct Knife to use the contents of environment variables to authenticate with OpenStack when needed. The environment variables are the ones you get when you source the OpenStack RC file of your project. The RC file can be downloaded from the OpenStack web UI (Horizon) by navigating to Access & Security -> API Access -> Download OpenStack RC file. Sourcing the file makes sure the environment variables are part of the current shell environment, and is done like this (for an RC file called "openstack-rc.sh"):

{% highlight shell %}
$ . openstack-rc.sh
{% endhighlight %}

With this config in place Knife now has the power to create new OpenStack VMs in your project, list all active VMs and destroy VMs. In addition, it can be used to list available images, flavors and networks in OpenStack. I do however prefer to use the native OpenStack clients (glance, nova, neutron) for that, since they can perform lots of other valuable tasks like creating new networks and so on.

Below is an example of VM creation with Knife, using some of the required and optional arguments to the command. Issue "knife openstack server create --help" to get all available arguments. As a quick summary, the arguments I give Knife are the requested hostname of the server, the flavor (3 = m1.medium in my cluster), image ID of a CentOS 7 image, network ID, SSH key name and the default user account used by the image ("centos").

With the "--openstack-floating-ip" argument I tell Knife to allocate a floating IP to the new server. I could have specified a specific floating IP after that argument, which would have been allocated to the new server whether it was in use before or not. The only requirement is that it must be allocated to my OpenStack project before I try to use it.

{% highlight shell %}
$ knife openstack server create -N test-server -f 3 -I b206baa3-3a80-41cf-9850-49021b8bb3c1 --network-ids df7cc182-8794-4134-b700-1fb8f1fbf070 --openstack-ssh-key-id arnes --ssh-user centos --openstack-floating-ip --no-host-key-verify

As an added benefit of creating VMs this way, they are automatically bootstrapped as Chef nodes with your Chef server!

## Configure Kitchen to use OpenStack

Kitchen has a config file "~/.kitchen/config.yml" where all the config required to use OpenStack should be placed. The config file is "global", meaning it's not part of any cookbook or Chef repository. The advantage of using the global config file is that the Kitchen config in each cookbook is reduced to just one line, which is good since that Kitchen config is commonly committed to the cookbook repository and shared with other developers. Other developers may not have access to the same OpenStack environment as you, so their Kitchen OpenStack config will differ from yours.

Run the following commands to initialize the necessary config for Kitchen:

{% highlight shell %}
mkdir ~/.kitchen
cat >> ~/.kitchen/config.yml <<EOF
---
driver:
 name: openstack
 openstack_username: <%= ENV['OS_USERNAME'] %>
 openstack_api_key: <%= ENV['OS_PASSWORD'] %>
 openstack_auth_url: <%= "#{ENV['OS_AUTH_URL']}/tokens" %>
 openstack_tenant: <%= ENV['OS_TENANT_NAME'] %>
 require_chef_omnibus: true
 image_ref: CentOS 7 GC 2014-09-16
 username: centos
 flavor_ref: m1.medium
 key_name: <%= ENV['OS_USERNAME'] %>
 floating_ip_pool: public
 network_ref:
 - net1
 no_ssh_tcp_check: true
 no_ssh_tcp_check_sleep: 30
EOF
{% endhighlight %}

There is quite a bit of config going on here, so I'll go through some of the most important parts. Many of the configuration options rely on environment variables which are set when you source the OpenStack RC file, just like for Knife. In addition, the following options may need to be customized according to your OpenStack environment:

- image_ref: The name of a valid image to use when creating VMs
- username: The username used by the chosen image, in this case "centos"
- flavor_ref: A valid name of a flavor to use when creating VMs
- key_name: Must match the name of your SSH key in OpenStack, here it is set to equal your username
- floating_ip_pool: The name of a valid pool of public IP addresses
- network_ref: A list of existing networks to connect new VMs to

To determine the correct values for image, flavor and network above, use the command line OpenStack clients. The Glance client can output a list of valid images to choose from:

{% highlight shell %}
$ glance image-list
+--------------------------------------+------------------------+-----+------+------------+--------+
| ID                                   | Name     | Disk Format | Container Format | Size | Status |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------+-----+------+------------+--------+
| ee2cc71b-3e2e-4b11-b327-f9cbf73a5694 | CentOS 6 GC 14-11-12   | raw | bare | 8589934592 | active |
| b206baa3-3a80-41cf-9850-49021b8bb3c1 | CentOS 7 GC 2014-09-16 | raw | bare | 8589934592 | active |
...
{% endhighlight %}

Set the image_ref in the Kitchen config to either the ID, the name or a regex matching the name.

Correspondingly, find the allowed flavors with the Nova client:

{% highlight shell %}
$ nova flavor-list
+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+
| ID | Name      | Memory_MB | Disk | Ephemeral | Swap | VCPUs | RXTX_Factor | Is_Public |
+----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+
|  2 | m1.small  |    2048   |  20  |     0     |      |   1   |     1.0     |    True   |
|  3 | m1.medium |    4096   |  40  |     0     |      |   2   |     1.0     |    True   |
...
{% endhighlight %}

The network names are available using the neutron client. However, if you haven't created any networks yet, you can create a network, subnet and router like this:

{% highlight shell %}
neutron net-create net1
neutron subnet-create --name subnet1 net1 10.0.0.0/24
neutron router-create gw
neutron router-gateway-set gw public
neutron router-interface-add gw subnet1
{% endhighlight %}

These commands assume that the external network in your OpenStack cluster is named "public". Assuming the commands complete successfully you may use the network name "net1" in the Kitchen config file. To get the list of available networks, use the Neutron client with the net-list subcommand:

{% highlight shell %}
$ neutron net-list
+--------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
| id                                   | name   | subnets |
+--------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 2d2b2336-d7b6-4adc-b7f2-c92f98d4ec58 | public | 5ac43f4f-476f-4513-8f6b-67a758aa56e7 |
| e9dcbda9-cded-4823-a9fe-b03aadf33346 | net1   | 8ba65517-9bf5-46cc-a392-03a0708cd7f3 10.0.0.0/24 |
+--------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
{% endhighlight %}

With all that configured, Kitchen is ready to use OpenStack as the driver instead of Vagrant. All you need to do in a cookbook to make Kitchen use the OpenStack driver, is to change the "driver" statement in the ".kitchen.yml" config file in the cookbook root directory from "vagrant" to "openstack":

{% highlight shell %}
---
driver:
 name: openstack
{% endhighlight %}

So, lets take it for a spin:

{% highlight shell %}
$ kitchen create

Voilà :)
